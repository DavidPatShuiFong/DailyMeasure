<!-- stylesheets from fomantic.ui (a fork of semantic.ui)
Note that this is a specially edited version of semantic.css that is provided with fomantic

However, I have removed a lot of margin/padding/font re-definition that is included in the header,
which disturbs the layout of shiny/flexdashboard

<!-- Pushes the export/save buttons for datatables to the right
