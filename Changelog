front-end to DailyMeasure package


Modularization

* dMeasureQIM (quality improvement measures) is now an optional module/package
  changes to UI and server to allow dynamic creation of tabItems and sidebarMenu

Version 1.3.2, 18th September 2019
==================================

Improvements

* Quality Improvement Measures appointments view
  Uses separate package version of dMeasureQIM

* datatable_styled accepts arguments which allow
  selectable button extensions

* Remove DiabetesSIP and AsthmaSIP from default CDM list

  These items are no longer available for billing

Bug-fix

* Move demographic_group and ignoreOld in QIM Measures
  to 'common' titlebar area

  Having separate demographic_group buttons could cause
  a race-condition

---------------------------------

* Requires dMeasure back-end 0.4.99

* Changes to billing display
  Integrates appointment, visit and billing view
